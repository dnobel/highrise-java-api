# Highrise Java API

Highrise Java API is a java client library for the [Highrise CRM API](http://github.com/37signals/highrise-api/). It contains the main entities of Highrise as Java classes and provides a clean and simple to use API to access the entities from Highrise. As this project was extracted from an Highrise Android app (see https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nobel.topliftcrm), the client library can be used for Android apps, too.

The Highrise Java API is still under development. Therefore only a limited set of entities and resource are supported yet. Most resources provide read access only. Creating and updating entities is in an experimental stage. If you would  like to contribute feel free to open a pull request.

## How to use

### Download JAR (with dependencies)

Last versions from Highrise Java API can be downloaded as JAR with packaged dependencies:

* [highrise-java-api-1.0.1.jar](https://github.com/dnobel/highrise-java-api/raw/master/release/highrise-java-api-1.0.1.jar) (Web version)
* [highrise-java-api-1.0.1-with-dependencies.jar](https://github.com/dnobel/highrise-java-api/raw/master/release/highrise-java-api-1.0.1-with-dependencies.jar) (Web version with dependencies)
* [highrise-java-api-android-1.0.1.jar](https://github.com/dnobel/highrise-java-api/raw/master/release/highrise-java-api-1.0.1-android.jar) (Android version)

### Maven

As Highrise Java API is not yet deployed on a public maven repoistory, you must deploy it into your local repository fist. Therefore clone the repo with `git clone git://github.com/dnobel/highrise-java-api.git`, call `mvn install -Dweb-build` (for web version) and add a dependency to your maven project:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.nobel</groupId>
        <artifactId>org.nobel.highriseapi</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Important: You must build/deploy/etc your project with a special property, because the Highrise API pom has to profiles, which define different dependencies for web and android use (mainly because of spring). These profiles are activated via the properties `web-build` and `android-build`. Therefore start your maven build with `mvn package -Dandroid-build` for an android app for example. In the future it might be better to have two different artifacts, but that makes it hard to handle in one eclipse project.

## API Usage

### Login and Authentication

The HighriseClient class provides a facade for accessing all resources. At first a client must be instantiated for a specific URL. If you already have an API token, you can create the client with the token as second argument directly. Otherwise you must only provide the base URL of the Highrise REST API. In the next step you can authenticate the client against the API with a username and a password. The client ist stateful, which means that it stores the API token after the authentication and uses it for all following request.   

Here's an example how to to instantiate the client and authenticate afterwards:

    HighriseClient highriseClient = HighriseClient.create("https://example.highrisehq.com/");
    highriseClient.auth("username", "password"));

The `auth` method returns the token which might be stored by the application to avoid a login within the next application start. The token can stored within the app preferences on android for example. If the activity of the app is recreated the client can be instantiated with the token directly, so that user mustnot login again.

    HighriseClient highriseClient = HighriseClient.create("https://example.highrisehq.com/", "token");

### Working with Resources

Data can be requested via type specific resources. For each supported entity there is a resource, which provides access to the entity data. The method `getResource(Class<? extends EntityResource>)` returns a resource for the given resource class. Each resource has methods like `get`, `getAll`, `create` and `update` (create and updated are not fully implemented yet). Some resources define extra functions like the `TaskResource`, which has a method `getCompleted` that only returns the completed tasks.

The following code example shows how different entities can be requested via resources:

    UserResource userResource = highriseClient.getResource(UserResource.class);
    
    // returns all users
    List<User> users = userResource.getAll();
    
    // retrievs a single user by id
    int firstUserId = users.get(0).getId();
    User user = userResource.get(firstUserId);
    
    // returns the user for the token which is used be the client
    User me = userResource.getMe()
    
    // returns a list of completed tasks
    List<Task> completedTasks = highriseClient.getResource(TaskResource.class).getCompleted();

The note resource is special, as notes can only be requested for other entities like Cases or Deals. Therefore the resource functions "getAll" does always returns an empty list. You must call `getAll(NoteKind.CASE_NOTES, 10)` where 10 is the deal id for example. Ssupported note kinds are `CASE_NOTES` and `DEAL_NOTES` so far. Moreover `NoteResource` is the only resource that supports creation of entities yet. For example with `createForEntity(NoteKind.CASE_NOTES, 10, note)` you can create note for a case with the id 10.

Here's an example snippet how to use the NoteResource:

    NoteResource noteResource = highriseClient.getResource(NoteResource.class);
    
    // returns all notes for case with id 10
    List<Note> notes = noteResource.getAll(NoteKind.CASE_NOTES, 10);
    
    // returns all notes for deal with id 5
    notes = noteResource.getAll(NoteKind.DEAL_NOTES, 5);
    
    // creates a note for case with id 10
    Note note = new Note();
    note.setBody("Some text...");
    noteResource.createForEntity(NoteKind.CASE_NOTES, 10, note);
    
### Caching

Highrise Java API supports a simple in memory cache, that caches lists of entities. If caching is enabled and the cache is not explicitly cleared the second API call will not get the entities from remote but use the cache instead. Cache can be activated for the HighriseClient class by calling "setUseCache(true)". By default the cache is disabled.

    HighriseClient highriseClient = HighriseClient.create("https://example.highrisehq.com/", "token");
    highriseClient.setUseCache(true);
    
    // data will be fetched from remote, as cache is empty
    highriseClient.getResource(UserResource.class).getAll();
    
    // second call uses cached list now 
    highriseClient.getResource(UserResource.class).getAll();
    
    // clears the cache for the user resource (has no effect if cache is disabled)
    highriseClient.getResource(UserResource.class).clear();
